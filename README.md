# Machinne_Learning_Project

This project uses Machine Learning techniques in order to classify bearish and bullish investor sentiment using stock market variables as the features of my dataset. 

The analysis and data preparation are conducted in Jupiter Notebook.

In order to run the .ipynb files, download all .csv files in the same location before running. 

In order to better understand the preparation and analysis in this project, please read through the paper "Classifying Investor Sentiment". 

Thank you and I hope you enjoy my project!
